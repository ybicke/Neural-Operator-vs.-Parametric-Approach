# Neural-Operator-vs.-Parametric-Approach

In this project, the aim is to investigate and compare two strategies for forecasting the future behavior of the PDE
system at a specified time t = T. The first strategy employs a parametric approach, while the second strategy
involves an operator-based approach, with particular emphasis on the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). The applicability of both
approaches is tested and compared on the heat equation, followed by the wave equation. Since an exact solution exists, 
the data for training could simply be generated for different time intervals. The model then uses this data for training and inference.
