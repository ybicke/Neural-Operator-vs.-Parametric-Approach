# Neural-Operator-vs.-Parametric-Approach
Compared Fourier Neural Operator against the Parametrich approach using a standard MLP for predicting the evolution the PDE of a 2D heat and wave equation

This simple toymodel problem uses the analytic solution of the PDE from the heat and wave equation. Since an exact solution exists, the data for training could simply be generated for different time intervals. The model then uses this data for training and inference.
